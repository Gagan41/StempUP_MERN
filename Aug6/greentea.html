  <h1>Green tea</h1>
  <p><b> Green tea </b>is a type of tea made from the leaves and buds of the Camellia sinensis that have not undergone the withering and oxidation process that creates oolong teas and black teas.[1] Green tea originated in China in the late 1st millennium BC, and since then its production and manufacture has spread to other countries in East Asia.</p> <br>
  <p>Several varieties of green tea exist, which differ substantially based on the variety of C. sinensis used, growing conditions, horticultural methods, production processing, and time of harvest. While it may slightly lower blood pressure and improve alertness, current scientific evidence does not support most health benefit claims, and excessive intake of green tea extracts can cause liver damage and other side effects.</p>
