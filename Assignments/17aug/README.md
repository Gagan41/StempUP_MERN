# ApexCorp Global — Multi-page HTML Site

This is a pure HTML multi-page website for **ApexCorp Global**, with pages for Home, Services, and Investors. It demonstrates semantic structure, accessibility, and clean navigation without using CSS or JavaScript.

## Semantic Structure

- `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, `<footer>` — to clearly separate content and improve accessibility.
- `<table>` with `<caption>`, `<thead>`, `<tbody>`, `<tfoot>` — to present structured service offerings.
- `<dl>`, `<dt>`, `<dd>` — to display investor key facts.
- Forms with `<label>` and `<input>` for accessible IR contact.

## How to Run

Simply open `index.html` in any modern web browser. Use the navigation links to move between **Home**, **Services**, and **Investors** pages.

## Assumptions & Limitations

- Placeholder images are referenced (`Images/`) — ensure these files exist for links to work.
- Styling and interactivity are not included (no CSS/JS).
- Form uses a `mailto:` action, which depends on the user’s email client being configured.
