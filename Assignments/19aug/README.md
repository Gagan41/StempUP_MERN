# CSS Box Model Demo

## What I Built
I created a simple web page that visually demonstrates the CSS box model, showing the relationship between **Content, Padding, Border, and Margin**. Each layer has a unique background color, label, and hover effect for better understanding.

## HTML & CSS Used
- **HTML**: Used `<div>` elements to represent each layer (Margin, Border, Padding, Content) and a `<main>` wrapper for semantic structure.  
- **CSS**: Applied `margin`, `border`, `padding`, and `width/height` to illustrate the box model. Added `background-color` for visual distinction, `outline` for margin boundaries, and `:hover` effects for interactivity.

## How to Run
1. Download the project.  
2. Open `index.html` directly in any modern browser.  
3. Hover over each section to see the background color change.
