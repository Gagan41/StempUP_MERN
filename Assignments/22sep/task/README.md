# 📅 Smart Task Planner

## 📖 About
This is a **Smart Task Planner** built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.  
It helps students manage their study and personal tasks by adding tasks, marking them complete, viewing deadlines, and checking overdue/pending tasks.

---

## 🚀 Features
- Add tasks with title, description, and due date
- Mark tasks as complete
- View all tasks, only today’s tasks, or overdue tasks
- Color-coded tasks:
  - 🟡 Pending (yellow)
  - ✅ Completed (green, crossed out)
  - 🔴 Overdue (red)
- Countdown timer for the nearest upcoming deadline

---

## 🛠️ Tech Used
- **HTML5**: Semantic tags like `<header>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, `<footer>`
- **CSS3**: Styling with colors, flexbox, and hover effects
- **JavaScript (ES6)**:
  - Objects & Arrays for task storage
  - Date methods (`getDate()`, `getMonth()`, `toLocaleDateString()`)
  - DOM manipulation for interactivity
