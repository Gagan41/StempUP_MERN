# 🎓 Student Attendance Manager

## 📌 What I Built
I created a simple **Student Attendance Manager** that allows a teacher to:
- Mark daily attendance (using a Set so no duplicates are added).
- Keep track of each student’s total attendance across days (using a Map).
- Handle errors if an unregistered student is marked.

## 🛠️ Features Used
- **HTML** → Semantic tags (`header`, `main`, `section`, `footer`) for structure.
- **CSS** → Styling with colors, spacing, hover effects, and responsiveness.
- **JavaScript** → 
  - Set for today’s attendance  
  - Map for total attendance  
  - DOM manipulation for interactivity  
  - Error handling for invalid students

## ▶️ How to Run
1. Clone/download this project.
2. Open `index.html` in any modern browser.
3. Start marking attendance!

## ⚠️ Assumptions & Limitations
- Works only for the predefined registered students (`Alice, Bob, Charlie`).
- Student names must be typed exactly (case-sensitive).
- Daily attendance must be ended using the **"End Day"** button before the next day’s attendance begins.
