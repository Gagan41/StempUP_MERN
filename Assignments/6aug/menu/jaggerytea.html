      <h1>Jaggery tea</h1>
      <p>
        <b> Jaggery tea </b>is also known as "gud ki chai", is a popular
        beverage, particularly in Maharashtra and Karnataka, where it's gaining
        popularity due to its potential health benefits and unique flavor.

        It's made by adding jaggery (a type of unrefined sugar) to tea, along
        with spices like ginger and cardamom. Jaggery, derived from sugarcane or
        palm sap, offers a different sweetness profile compared to refined sugar
        and is believed to have various health advantages.While jaggery is a
        natural sweetener, it's still a source of carbohydrates and calories, so
        portion control is important, especially for those managing blood sugar
        levels or weight.
