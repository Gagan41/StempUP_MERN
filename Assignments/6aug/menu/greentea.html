      <h1>Green tea</h1>
      <p>
        <b> Green tea </b>is a type of tea made from the leaves and buds of the
        Camellia sinensis that have not undergone the withering and oxidation
        process that creates oolong teas and black teas.[1] Green tea originated
        in China in the late 1st millennium BC, and since then its production
        and manufacture has spread to other countries in East Asia.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Several varieties of green tea exist, which differ substantially based
        on the variety of C. sinensis used, growing conditions, horticultural
        methods, production processing, and time of harvest. While it may
        slightly lower blood pressure and improve alertness, current scientific
        evidence does not support most health benefit claims, and excessive
        intake of green tea extracts can cause liver damage and other side
        effects.
