      <h1>Grape Juice</h1>
      <p>
        Grape juice is made from crushed and pressed grapes. It can be made from
        red, purple, or green grapes and is naturally sweet with a rich flavor.

      <p>
        Grape juice contains antioxidants, especially resveratrol, which may
        benefit heart health. It is often used as a base for jams, jellies, and
        wines.
