        comes in many varieties and is enjoyed by people of all ages.

      <p>
        Ice cream is a frozen dessert typically made from milk or cream that has
        been flavoured with a sweetener, either sugar or an alternative, and a
        spice, such as cocoa or vanilla, or with fruit, such as strawberries or
        peaches. Food colouring is sometimes added in addition to stabilizers.
        The mixture is cooled below the freezing point of water and stirred to
        incorporate air spaces and prevent detectable ice crystals from forming.
        It can also be made by whisking a flavoured cream base and liquid
        nitrogen together. The result is a smooth, semi-solid foam that is solid
        at very low temperatures (below 2 °C or 35 °F). It becomes more
        malleable as its temperature increases.
