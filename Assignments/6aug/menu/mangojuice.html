        A mango is an edible stone fruit produced by the tropical tree Mangifera
        indica. It originated from the region between northwestern Myanmar,
        Bangladesh, and northeastern India.[1][2] M. indica has been cultivated
        in South and Southeast Asia since ancient times resulting in two types
        of modern mango cultivars: the "Indian type" and the "Southeast Asian
        type".[1][2] Other species in the genus Mangifera also produce edible
        fruits that are also called "mangoes", the majority of which are found
        in the Malesian ecoregion
