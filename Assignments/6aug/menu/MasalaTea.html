      <h1>Masala tea</h1>
      <p>
        <b>Masala Tea</b>is a popular beverage originating from South Asia. It
        is made by brewing black tea (usually crush, tear, curl) in milk and
        water, and then by sweetening with sugar. Adding aromatic herbs and
        spices creates masala chai

        Tea was introduced to India by the British as a popular beverage. Tea
        plants have grown wild in the Assam region since antiquity, but
        historically, Indians viewed tea as a herbal medicine rather than as a
        recreational beverage
