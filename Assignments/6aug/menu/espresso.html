      <p>
        Espresso is a concentrated form of coffee made by forcing hot water through finely ground coffee under high pressure.

        Originating from Italy, espresso serves as the base for many other coffee drinks like lattes, cappuccinos, and Americanos. It’s rich, bold, and served in small quantities due to its intensity. Known for its "crema" layer, it’s popular among coffee connoisseurs.
