      <h1>Cold Coffee</h1>
      <p>
        Cold coffee is a chilled beverage made with coffee, milk, sugar, and
        ice. It is a popular summer refreshment served in cafes and homes.

        It is regularly available in most coffee shops. Iced coffee is generally
        brewed at a higher strength than normal coffee, given that it is diluted
        by the melting ice. In Australia, "iced coffee" is a common term for
        packaged coffee-flavored and sweetened milk beverage. Iced coffee is
        made by brewing hot coffee, and pouring it over ice; Cold brew coffee is
        made without heat by steeping coffee grounds into lukewarm water.
