      <h1>Black Coffee</h1>
      <p>
        Black coffee is brewed coffee without any added milk or sugar. It’s
        known for its bold flavor and health benefits like boosting metabolism.

        Coffee production begins when the seeds from coffee cherries (the Coffea
        plant's fruits) are separated to produce unroasted green coffee beans.
        The "beans" are roasted and then ground into fine particles. Coffee is
        brewed from the ground roasted beans, which are typically steeped in hot
        water before being filtered out. It is usually served hot, although
        chilled or iced coffee is common. Coffee can be prepared and presented
        in a variety of ways (e.g., espresso, French press, caffè latte, or
        already-brewed canned coffee). Sugar, sugar substitutes, milk, and cream
        are often added to mask the bitter taste or enhance the flavor.
