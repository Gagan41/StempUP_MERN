        A samosa (/səˈmoʊsə/) (listenⓘ) (Hindi: समोसा) ( Persian: سمبوسه) is a
        fried South Asian[2] and West Asian snack. It is a pastry with a savory
        filling that mostly consists of vegetables like spiced potatoes, onions,
        and peas, but can also include meat or fish, or even cheese. Its name
        originates from the Middle Persian word sambosag (سنبوسگ) (meaning
        'triangular pastry'). It is made in different shapes, including
        triangular, cone, or crescent, depending on the region.[3][4][5] Samosas
        are often accompanied by chutney, and have origins in medieval times or
        earlier.[3] Sweet versions are also made. Samosas are a popular entrée,
        appetizer, or snack in the cuisines of South Asia, Southeast Asia, West
        Asia, Central Asia, Portugal, East Africa and their South Asian
        diasporas.
