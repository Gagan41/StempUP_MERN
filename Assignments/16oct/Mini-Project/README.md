## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Execution Steps

1. Download or clone the project folder.
2. Ensure all HTML files (`index.html`, `services.html`, `investors.html`) are in the same directory as `script.js`.
3. Open any HTML file in a web browser.
4. Interact with the following features:

   * Page-specific banner below the header
   * Mission heading toggle (on homepage)
   * Hero image hover animation
   * Auto-generated testimonials section
   * Smooth scroll for ‚ÄúSkip to Content‚Äù links
   * Real-time clock updating in footer

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Assumptions / Limitations

* Script relies on standard DOM APIs ‚Äî no external libraries are used.
* Features like ‚ÄúMission Toggle‚Äù appear only on pages that include corresponding elements.
* The investor contact form uses `mailto:` for demo purposes (no backend).
* Time display uses the system‚Äôs local timezone.
