   - **Descendant & Child Selectors:** Styling `<p>` tags differently based on their hierarchy inside a `<div>`.
   - **Attribute Selectors:** Styling links based on their `href` attribute values.

2. **CSS Colors**
   - **Named Colors:** Using predefined color names (e.g., red, blue, green, orange).
   - **HEX Colors:** Applying colors using HEX codes.
   - **RGB & RGBA Colors:** Demonstrating RGB color values and RGBA transparency.
