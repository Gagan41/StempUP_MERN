# 🌿 Nature Video Player (Flexbox Gallery)

## 📌 Project Overview
I built a responsive **nature video player webpage** using **HTML5 and CSS Flexbox**. The gallery displays 25 short, high-quality videos in a clean 5-per-row layout with a professional design. It is fully responsive and adapts to different screen sizes.

## 🏗️ Technologies & Reasoning
- **HTML5 Semantic Tags**: Used `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, `<article>`, and `<footer>` for better structure, SEO, and accessibility.  
- **CSS Flexbox**: Used `display: flex`, `flex-wrap`, `justify-content`, and `gap` to align videos evenly.  
- **Styling**: Applied cohesive color scheme, hover effects, `box-shadow`, `border-radius`, and Google Fonts for a polished look.  
- **Media Queries**: Ensured responsiveness for desktops, tablets, and mobiles.  
- **JavaScript (optional)**: Enables filtering by categories like *Mountains, Oceans, Forests*.

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Add your videos inside the `images/` folder and images too.
2. Open `index.html` in any modern browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari).  
2. Use the navigation and filter buttons to explore videos.

## ⚠️ Assumptions & Limitations
- Example video files are placeholders; you must add your own `.mp4` videos.  
- Filtering requires JavaScript; core layout and responsiveness work with HTML & CSS only.  
- Lightbox/fullscreen mode uses the browser’s built-in `<video>` controls.  
- Designed mainly for educational/demo purposes (Flexbox assignment).
