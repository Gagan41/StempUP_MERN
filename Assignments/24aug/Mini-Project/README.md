ApexCorp Global — Multi-page Website

This project is a multi-page static website built for ApexCorp Global. It includes pages for Home, Services, and Investors, showcasing company information, offerings, and investor relations. The site was designed to demonstrate semantic HTML, clean navigation, and accessible content. In this update, CSS has been added to improve visual presentation, responsiveness, and overall readability without using JavaScript.

Semantic Structure
<header>, <nav>, <main>, <section>, <footer> — used to separate content logically and enhance accessibility.
<table> with <caption>, <thead>, <tbody>, <tfoot> — used for structured service offerings and investor data.
<form>, <label>, <input>, <textarea> — used to create an accessible Investor Relations contact form.

CSS Rules Used
Typography: Set base font-family, readable line-height, and heading hierarchy.
Color & Contrast: Applied a navy-and-white theme for accessibility and brand feel.
Layout & Spacing: Used margins, paddings, and max-width for clean alignment.
Navigation Styling: Flexbox for horizontal menus, hover/focus states for interactivity.
Responsive Media: Applied max-width: 100%; height: auto; for images.
Forms & Buttons: Styled inputs, selects, and buttons with borders, padding, and hover effects for usability.

How to Run
Simply open index.html in any modern web browser. Use the navigation bar to move between Home, Services, and Investors pages.

Assumptions & Limitations
Images are referenced from the Images/ folder — ensure these files exist for proper display.
Forms use a mailto: action, which requires an email client configured on the user’s device.
No JavaScript has been used — functionality is limited to static content and form submission via email.
