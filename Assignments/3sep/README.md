# Library Book Tracker

A simple web app that demonstrates **basic JavaScript array methods** (`push`, `pop`, `unshift`, `shift`, `includes`, `indexOf`) using a library of book titles.  
It starts with a fixed array of books and lets users run operations step by step, displaying clear results after each action.

---

## What I Built (Short Summary)
- A browser-based **Library Book Tracker** with semantic HTML, modern CSS styling, and interactive JavaScript.
- Users can add/remove books or check availability using array methods, with results shown in a live output box.

---

## Tech/Features & Why
- **Semantic HTML**: `<header>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, `<article>`, `<footer>` for accessibility and clear structure.  
- **CSS**: Centered responsive layout, styled cards, color-coded buttons (green for add, red for remove, blue for check).  
- **JavaScript**: Uses `push`, `pop`, `unshift`, `shift`, `includes`, and `indexOf` for array manipulation.  
  - `querySelector` / `getElementById` for DOM access.  
  - Event listeners for button clicks.  
  - Live output area with step-by-step updates.

## How to Run
1. Download or clone this project.  
2. Open `index.html` directly in a browser (no server required).  

---

## Assumptions / Limitations
- The app starts with a **predefined list**:  
  `["Harry Potter", "The Hobbit", "The Alchemist", "Sherlock Holmes"]`  
- Search (`includes`/`indexOf`) is **case-sensitive**.  
- Only basic array methods are demonstrated (per assignment requirement).
